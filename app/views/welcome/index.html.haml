        You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
        mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.
        After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know
        exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us
        survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath,
        that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
        other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle
        to man.

        The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the
        animals in case they ever got off the island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene
        that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals
        can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually
        supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

        Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody
        lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me
        I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world
        where righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if
        you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're gonna have to pay
        the price.
